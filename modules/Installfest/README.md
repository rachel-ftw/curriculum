# Installfest

This module will help you install all the packages and applications you will
need for phase 1. The skills in this module will be useful whenever you want to
install, uninstall and upgrade packages and application on OS X.

## Skills

- Can install packages via homebrew, in the terminal
- Can install desktop applications via brew cask, in the terminal
- Can install a code linter in your editor

## Exercises

Your first task will be to install `homebrew` (if you haven't already)

Using `brew` and `brew cask` install the following packages:

```
google-chrome
sublime-text
atom
git
iterm2
postgresql
postico
```

`postgresql` should only ever be installed using homebrew; the standalone
installer creates conflicts.

optionally, consider also installing the following applications/packages using "brew cask install" command to install into your application folder using the command line:

```
caffeine
dash
growlnotify
slack
screenhero
spectacle
postman
xcode command line tools
```

We would also recommend installing [copyclip](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history-manager/id595191960?mt=12) through the mac app store.
